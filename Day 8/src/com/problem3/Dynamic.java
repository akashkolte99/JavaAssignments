//	Explain dynamic polymorphism ?
	
	
//	It is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than
//	compile-time.
//	In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a
//	superclass. The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being
//	referred to by the reference variable.
	
	
//	class A{ //Parent class
//		--
//		}
//		class B extends A{ //Child class
//		--
//		}
//		A a=new B();//upcasting, this is only possible if B class is a child class of A
